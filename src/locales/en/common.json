        "p-1": "Khun Pui's journey began in Northeast Thailand, where she first discovered her passion for traditional healing arts. After moving to Berlin in 2000, she returned to Thailand to train at the prestigious Wat Po Traditional Medical School in Bangkok - the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. This intensive certification equipped her with authentic techniques passed down through generations of Thai healers.",
        "p-2": "In September 2025, Anavaree Thai Massage was born as a true family enterprise, named lovingly after Pui's daughter who inspired her return to massage therapy. With over 20 years of experience, Pui works alongside her daughter as co-practitioner, while her supportive husband ensures every aspect runs smoothly. This family approach means every client receives genuine, personal care.",
        "p-3": "What sets us apart is our commitment to comprehensive therapeutic care. Every treatment begins with a thorough consultation, includes fresh linens and complimentary Thai tea, and ends with personalized aftercare guidance.",
        "p-4": "We specialize in neck, shoulder, and back conditions, with many clients experiencing significant improvement after just one session.",
